Tri Lite, Inc. is a leading designer and manufacturer of specialty lighting and electrical products for the material handling, office supply, and safety markets.

Founded in 1987 as a spin-off, yet independently operated company from Trippe Manufacturing, Tri Liteâ€™s dock lights and signals, warning lights, back-up alarms, and sirens can be found on loading docks, forklifts, emergency vehicles, and in an array of other business and industrial settings. Our durable, high-quality components and accessories are made in the U.S.A. to be sold globally through dealers, distributors, and original equipment manufacturers.

Tri Lite is proud that its innovative lighting and electrical designs are still manufactured in the USA. Customers can now choose between tradition incandescent or high intensity, energy efficient LEDs on many products. With LEDs, Tri Lite has extended the useful life of a dock light from 500 hours to a minimum of 60,000 hours with a five year bulb replacement warranty.
